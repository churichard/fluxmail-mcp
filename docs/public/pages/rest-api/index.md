Fluxmail exposes a REST API at `/api/v1` alongside its MCP endpoint. It uses the same connected mailboxes, permissions, and plan limits as MCP.

## Start locally

Complete the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart), then create an API key and start the HTTP server:

```bash
fluxmail apikey create \
  --name local-script

fluxmail serve
```

Copy the `fmk_...` key when Fluxmail displays it. The local base URL is `http://localhost:8977/api/v1`.

Pass the key as a bearer token. For example, list the accounts available to the key:

```bash
export FLUXMAIL_API_KEY='fmk_...'

curl http://localhost:8977/api/v1/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUXMAIL_API_KEY"
```

Use the returned account ID in mailbox routes. If you expose the HTTP server outside your computer, protect it with HTTPS and a firewall or reverse proxy.

## Administrative access

Routes under `/api/v1/admin` accept a member session or API key. A session must belong to a current administrator. An API key must belong to a current administrator and include the capability for the requested operation:

| Capability | Access |
| --- | --- |
| `admin.accounts` | Connect or reauthorize mailboxes and update IMAP settings. |
| `admin.api_keys` | List, create, update, and revoke API keys. |
| `admin.members` | Manage members, invitations, roles, statuses, and sessions. |
| `admin.audit` | Read security audit events. |
| `admin.license` | Read license status and activate a license key. |

The first member is the initial administrator. Administrators can use their CLI session directly. Create an administrative API key only when automation needs these routes:

```bash
fluxmail apikey create \
  --name instance-admin \
  --profile full \
  --admin admin.accounts \
  --admin admin.api_keys \
  --admin admin.members \
  --admin admin.audit \
  --admin admin.license
```

Remote administrative requests require HTTPS. Requests from the local computer can use HTTP.

If a reverse proxy terminates TLS and connects to Fluxmail from a non-loopback address, set `FLUXMAIL_TRUST_PROXY=1`. Enable it only when the proxy overwrites forwarded headers and prevents clients from reaching Fluxmail directly.

## Common behavior

- JSON responses put results in `data`. Paginated responses provide `meta.nextPageToken`.
- Send and forward requests require an `Idempotency-Key` header. Their endpoint pages explain safe retries.
- API keys use the profiles and capabilities described in [Permissions](/docs/permissions).
- Errors return an `error` object with a stable `code` and `message`.

## OpenAPI schema

The OpenAPI 3.1 schema is public:

```text
curl http://localhost:8977/api/v1/openapi.json \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUXMAIL_API_KEY"
```

Use the schema or the endpoint pages for request parameters, JSON bodies, and response details.
