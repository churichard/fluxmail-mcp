The Fluxmail CLI reads and manages email through a selected local or remote instance. It also starts MCP and REST servers and handles instance administration. Run `fluxmail setup` for a new local instance, or use `fluxmail login` to add an existing instance. See [Authentication and instances](/docs/authentication-and-instances) for profiles, sessions, and remote URL rules.

See [Use the CLI](/docs/use-the-cli) for email, setup, and administration workflows. This page is the complete command reference.

## Install the CLI

Install Fluxmail globally:

```bash
npm install -g fluxmail
```

To run a command without a global installation, replace `fluxmail` with `npx -y fluxmail@latest`. Pin an exact version instead of `@latest` to stay on one release.

If Fluxmail runs under Docker, prefix each command with `docker compose exec fluxmail`. For example:

```bash
docker compose exec fluxmail fluxmail accounts list
```

<!-- END GENERATED:cli-command-reference -->

Add `--help` to a command to view its usage in the terminal. For example, run `fluxmail accounts add --help`.

## Gmail and Outlook connections

Fluxmail uses the hosted browser flow when `FLUXMAIL_PUBLIC_URL` is a non-loopback address. Otherwise, it uses the local loopback flow. Hosted links expire after 10 minutes and work once.

The `--hosted` and `--local` options override the automatic choice. You cannot combine them or use them with an IMAP account. The provider name `microsoft` is an alias for `outlook`.

## IMAP account options

`fluxmail accounts add imap` accepts separate settings for incoming and outgoing mail. Without a password environment variable, Fluxmail prompts for the password in an interactive terminal.

See [Connect IMAP/SMTP](/docs/connect-an-imap-mailbox) for a complete setup example and help with folder detection.

## MCP permission options

The named profiles are `read-only`, `read-write`, and `full`. Use repeated `--allow` options to build a custom policy. You cannot combine `--profile` and `--allow` on the same command.

Permissions passed to `fluxmail stdio` apply to that process. HTTP permissions are stored with the API key and can be changed with `fluxmail apikey permissions`. See [Permissions](/docs/permissions) for the capability list and workflow requirements.
